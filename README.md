This application is designed for the user to enter a city, and be presented with the weather forcast for the next 5 days.  Once the forcast is displayed, 
the city is saved to local storage so the user can view the weather for that city the next time they open the app.  

This assignment was defineately a challenge with using an API but i managed to figure out how to use dot notation to grab the specific items I was looking for. After figuring out how to traverse the API correctly the rest was mostly a review from past assignments. I feel much more confident with using local storage as well as third party APIs. I had a lot of fun with this application and I am really appreciating how useful API can be in the real world!
